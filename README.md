### What is this app?

This application is intended to be a platform for my wife to post reviews of makeup and make a blog. This application is utilizing **Express.js** for the backend with **Pug.js** templating engine to format the frontend. This application will have a very basic *authentication* and will utilize **MongoDB** for the database (using `.json` flat file to work through the initial data provided).
